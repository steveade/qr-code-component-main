## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I used this project as an opportunity to make use of some best practices, such as safely setting the box-sizing of elements to border-box:

```css
*, *::before, *::before {
  box-sizing: inherit;
}
 html {
  box-sizing: border-box;
 }
```
And I also made use of flexbox which I recently learned. I learned how to initialize git repositories locally and how to move them to GitHub.
I also practiced drafting out my solution on paper before actually coding.
